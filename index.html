          "Legends never die and Mac Miller not was but is a whole legend. Mac Miller 
          was a humble rock star, he was a rapper's rapper, he was an actor, a comedian, 
          a musical genius, a heartthrob. Mac Miller was a brother, he was my friend. 
          I loved him and I still love him."
